# rust-chromedriver-autoinstaller
A rewriting of Yeongbin Jo's [python-chromedriver-autoinstaller](https://github.com/yeongbin-jo/python-chromedriver-autoinstaller) in Rust.

I have only tested the library on Windows. If you've got a Mac or Linux computer and find an error, please open an issue or submit a PR!
